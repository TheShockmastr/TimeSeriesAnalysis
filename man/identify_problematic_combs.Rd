\title{Identify and remove bad combs}
\usage{
identify_problematic_combs(mat, min_shared_fields = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Matrix to investigate}

\item{min_shared_fields}{Minimum number of positions that are not NA in both
vectors in order not to flag the vector pair as problematic}
}
\description{
Hclust cannot handle matrices in which for some pairs of rows and columns,
only 1 or fewer shared values are non-NA. This function recurrently
identifies the most aggravating column/row, excludes that column/row and checks
whether more columns/rows need to be excluded
